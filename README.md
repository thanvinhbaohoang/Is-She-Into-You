Is She Into You ?

*Pick Which Cards Where You Are Sure The She Is Into You

## What Worked Well
Everything. I went through a lot of different iteration but changed last minute because turned out it was better to use
CSS input[radio] instead of trying to go through the pain of JavaScript. 

## What Didn't
The Original Page Was Going To Have Focus On Hover + Blur All Other Cards. However, doing that mess up the card flip effects so I have to get rid of that beautiful idea. 
Hover Effects on Button Now No Longer Work. I assume it is because the radio-button is covering up the "Yes" button itself.
