                <p> Yeah, still can't tell with that one...
                    Um, exercise equipment is pretty expensive         
                    and maybe she lives in a small apartment and just doesn't have space.    
                    So, maybe you find a good deal one rowing machines somewhere, you can show her the flyer.

                        were actually dates, so suppose then she says "How'd you like to <span class="bold"> come back to my place and watch Netflix tonight? </span>

                    Err, it's usually a pretty good indicator when a girl invites you to do something,

                    She probably has something pretty interesting to do upstairs
